##### TL;DR
<img width='200' src="docs/screenshots/selfdev_logo.png?raw=true" align="right" hspace="1" vspace="1">

The self.dev community focuses on self-development, productivity and cross-disciplinary collaborations. To increase the communities productivity and keep ourselves more accountable we are developing a dashboard which acts as a journal for every individuals monthly goal.

The idea is to help ourselves to focus on a single task through the whole month and track it on a dashboard which
mainly consist of 3 components:
* Table of the month
* Chart
* Scratchboard

## Background Story

As a community which focuses on _productivity_ and _self.development_ we want to create a web dashboard which everyone can use to keep track of a single goal to keep ourselves more accountable and help each user reaching our goals more effectively and efficiently. The motivation and inspiration comes from the YouTuber [Tina Hoang](https://www.scoreboardswithtina.com/) and the book **4 Disciplines of Execution** by Franklin Covey.

### **Main Idea**
Our idea is to create an independent **web dashboard** similar to the  [workout dashboard/](https://dashboard-twitch.vercel.app/ "https://dashboard-twitch.vercel.app/")) we used on TwitchTV but for generic goals like learning a (programming) language, getting your first job, working on a project - it can be anything.

### **Why the dashboard?**
On that dashboard, everyone can join, create a profile and should **define and focus one single long-term goal** they want to finish. That goal will be tracked by documenting the daily progress which will be act as an accountability- and motivation-booster for yourself and others. Meaning you will have to show up and add your progress to keep yourself accountable and motivated/motivate others.

**"It's like playing table tennis with a scoreboard: suddenly we all are more competitive and eager to win!""**

Adding a healthy pinch of competitive gamification to keep ourselves accountable sounds like a really nice way to improve ourselves. Each week we can come together (after Long's weekly co-working stream) and have a retrospective meeting discussing everyone's progress and challenges.
